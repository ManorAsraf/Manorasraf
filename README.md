## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This Profile presents two selected projects from the field of data analysis, reflecting the combination of in-depth technical knowledge, the use of industry-standard tools, and analytical thinking.

The projects were developed as part of my studies â€“ both as part of an academic degree and through external courses â€“ and represent a small sample of my broad skill set in data processing, advanced analysis, and deriving actionable insights to support decision-making.

**First Project (SQL & Excel): Tourism Attractiveness Ranking**

In the Data Analyst course final project, I created a model to rank countries' tourism attractiveness using SQL and Excel. I analyzed data on heritage sites, nature reserves, weather, happiness, safety, cost of living, and accessibility, applying data cleaning, correlation analysis, and weighted ranking. The results were presented via an interactive visualization.

**Second Project (Python & Big Data tools): Demographic Analysis and Forecasting**

In this project, as part of a Big Data course, I analyzed a large dataset with demographic and economic data (age, sector, salary, savings, expenses, education, and economic status). The data was cleaned and analyzed using Python (Spark and Pandas). A predictive machine learning model was developed to forecast future trends, providing insights for decision-making.
