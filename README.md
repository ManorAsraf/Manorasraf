## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This folder presents two selected projects from the field of data analysis, reflecting the combination of in-depth technical knowledge, the use of industry-standard tools, and analytical thinking.

The projects were developed as part of my studies â€“ both as part of an academic degree and through external courses â€“ and represent a small sample of my broad skill set in data processing, advanced analysis, and deriving actionable insights to support decision-making.
